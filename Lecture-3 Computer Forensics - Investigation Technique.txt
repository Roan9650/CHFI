Forensics Readiness Planning:-
-------------------------------------------
Forensics readiness planning refers to a set of processes required to achieve and maintain forensics readiness.

==>Potential evidence required for an incident
==>Determine the source of the evidence
==>Define a policy for pathway to legally extract electronic evidence with minimal break
==>Policy for Securely handling and storing the collected evidence
==>Identify if the incident requires full or formal investigation
==>Train the staff to handle the incident and preserve the evidence
==>Create a special process for documenting the procedure
==>Establish a legal advisory board to guide the investigation process


Importance of Computer Forensics Process:-
--------------------------------------------------------------
The rapid increase of cyber crimes has led to the development of various laws and standards that define cyber crimes, digital evidence, search and seizure methodology, evidence recovery and the investigation process

The investigators must follow a forensics investigation process that comply to local laws and established precedents. Any deviation from the standard process may endanger the complete investigation

As digital evidence are fragile(Critical) in nature, a proper and thorough forensic investigation process that ensures the integrity of evidence is critical to prove a case in a court of law

The investigators must follow a repeatable and well documented set of steps such that every iteration of analysis provides the same findings, or else the findings of the investigation can be invalidated during the cross examination in a court of law


Phases Of Computer Forensics Investigation:-
-----------------------------------------------------------------
					1. Pre-Investigation Phase
					2. Investigation Phase
					3. Post-Investigation Phase

Pre-Investigation Phase:- 
-------------------------------------
1. Deals with tasks to be performed prior to the commencement of actual investigation

#------------------------Computer Forensics as Part of Incident Response Plan---------------------#

Incident response is a process of responding to incidents that may have occurred due to security breach in the system or network.

==>Minimizes the damage and reduces recovery time and costs
==>Incident response professional includes identifying (how breach occurred, how to locate the method of breach & how to reduce the breach
==>Finding & analyzing the evidence to determine the culprit(apradhi) behind the incident via legally.
==>Organizations include incident response plan so that help to track and prosecute culprit who is responsible befind that incident.




#--------------------------------Need for Forensic Investigator---------------------------#
