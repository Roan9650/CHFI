Registry:-
---------------
Database of stored configuration information about the users, hardware, and software on a Windows system.

Although the registry was designed to configure the system, to do so, it tracks such a huge information about the user’s activities, the devices connected to system, what software was used & when etc. All of this can be useful for the forensic investigator in tracking the who, what, where, & when of a forensic investigation. The key is just knowing where to look for it.

The registry or Windows registry is a database of information, settings, options, and other values for software and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. When a program is installed, a new subkey is created in the registry. This subkey contains settings specific to that program, such as its location, version, and primary executable.
